# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an AI-powered chat application that generates dynamic user interfaces based on mathematical questions. Users can ask mathematical questions to an LLM (Mistral), which responds with both reasoning and executable UI component code. The backend securely parses and executes the UI code using VM2 sandboxing, while the frontend renders the generated UI components for user interaction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask mathematical questions in a chat interface, so that I can receive both explanations and interactive tools to solve my problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a mathematical question THEN the system SHALL display the message in the chat interface
2. WHEN a user submits a question THEN the system SHALL send the request to the Mistral LLM API
3. WHEN the LLM responds THEN the system SHALL display both the reasoning and any generated UI components
4. IF the user asks about calculations THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate input forms and calculation tools

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to generate interactive UI components for mathematical problems, so that I can input values and see calculations dynamically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI responds to mathematical questions THEN the system SHALL parse structured responses containing reasoning and UI code
2. WHEN UI code is present in the response THEN the system SHALL securely execute the code using VM2 sandboxing
3. WHEN UI components are generated THEN the system SHALL render forms, inputs, buttons, and calculation results
4. WHEN a user interacts with generated UI THEN the system SHALL update calculations and display results in real-time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to securely execute AI-generated code, so that the application remains safe from malicious code injection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI generates UI code THEN the system SHALL execute it within a VM2 sandbox environment
2. WHEN code execution occurs THEN the system SHALL only allow predefined safe functions (createElement, createInput, createButton, createForm)
3. IF malicious code is detected THEN the system SHALL reject execution and display an error message
4. WHEN UI components are created THEN the system SHALL only render trusted, validated component definitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and responsive chat interface, so that I can easily interact with the AI and view generated content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a chat interface with message list and input field
2. WHEN messages are displayed THEN the system SHALL show clear distinction between user messages and AI responses
3. WHEN UI components are rendered THEN the system SHALL integrate them seamlessly within the chat flow
4. WHEN the interface is viewed on different devices THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design using Tailwind CSS

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with generated calculators and forms, so that I can perform calculations and see immediate results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a calculator is generated THEN the system SHALL provide input fields for relevant parameters
2. WHEN a user enters values in generated forms THEN the system SHALL validate input types and ranges
3. WHEN calculation buttons are clicked THEN the system SHALL compute results and display them immediately
4. WHEN form interactions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain state using Zustand for consistent user experience

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle LLM API integration efficiently, so that responses are fast and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made to Mistral THEN the system SHALL handle authentication using environment variables
2. WHEN LLM responses are received THEN the system SHALL parse structured content with thought and UI sections
3. IF API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to users
4. WHEN multiple requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests without blocking the interface

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to work without requiring persistent storage, so that I can use it immediately without setup complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL function without database connections
2. WHEN chat sessions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation state in memory only
3. WHEN the page refreshes THEN the system SHALL start with a clean chat interface
4. WHEN users interact with the app THEN the system SHALL not require user authentication or data persistence
