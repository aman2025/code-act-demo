# Product Overview

## AI Chat Dynamic UI with Autonomous Agent System

An intelligent Next.js application that combines conversational AI with dynamic UI generation and autonomous agent capabilities. The system operates in two distinct modes: UI Generation Mode for creating interactive components and Agent Mode for tool-based problem solving.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Dual-Mode Intelligence**: Seamlessly switches between UI generation and autonomous agent execution
- **Dynamic UI Generation**: AI creates interactive components on-demand for complex interfaces
- **Autonomous Tool Execution**: Agent system uses specialized tools to solve problems directly
- **Secure Execution**: VM2 sandbox ensures safe code execution in both modes
- **Integrated Agent System**: Full autonomous operation with monitoring, error recovery, and human interaction

### Operating Modes

#### UI Generation Mode
- Creates interactive calculators, forms, and input widgets
- Generates dynamic React components from natural language
- Real-time calculations with persistent component state
- Ideal for: "Create a loan calculator", "Build a triangle area form"

#### Agent Mode  
- Autonomous problem-solving using specialized tools
- Direct calculation and data retrieval capabilities
- Tool-based execution with reasoning and monitoring
- Ideal for: "What is the area of a triangle with 5m sides?", "What's the weather in Paris?"

### Key Features
- **Intelligent Mode Detection**: Automatically determines optimal processing approach
- **Tool-Based Problem Solving**: Area calculations, percentage calculations, weather services
- **Interactive UI Components**: AI-generated forms, calculators, and input widgets
- **Autonomous Agent System**: Complete agent architecture with monitoring and error recovery
- **Secure Sandbox Execution**: VM2 protection for all code execution
- **State Management**: Persistent component and agent state across sessions
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Integrated human interaction for complex scenarios

### Available Tools
- **Area Calculator**: Triangle, rectangle, and circle area calculations
- **Percentage Calculator**: Various percentage operations and calculations  
- **Weather Service**: Location-based weather data and forecasts (mock implementation)
- **Extensible Tool System**: Easy addition of new specialized tools

### Target Use Cases
- **Educational Tools**: Interactive math calculators and learning interfaces
- **Problem Solving**: Direct calculation and data retrieval queries
- **Dynamic Interfaces**: Custom form and component generation
- **Autonomous Operations**: Complex multi-step problem solving with tool chains
- **Hybrid Workflows**: Seamless combination of UI generation and agent execution
