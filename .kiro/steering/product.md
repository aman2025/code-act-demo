# Product Overview

## AI Chat Dynamic UI

An AI-powered mathematical assistant that generates interactive UI components in response to user questions. The application combines conversational AI with dynamic component generation to create personalized calculators and tools.

### Core Features

- **Conversational Interface**: Chat-based interaction for asking mathematical questions
- **Dynamic UI Generation**: AI creates interactive forms, calculators, and input components
- **Secure Code Execution**: VM2 sandbox ensures safe execution of AI-generated code
- **Real-time Calculations**: Interactive components perform calculations with user inputs
- **State Persistence**: Component states are maintained across interactions

### User Flow

1. User asks a mathematical question (e.g., "Create a loan calculator")
2. AI generates both explanatory text and interactive UI components
3. User interacts with generated forms and calculators
4. System processes calculations and displays results inline
5. Component states persist for continued interaction

### Target Use Cases

- Mathematical education and learning
- Financial calculations (loans, investments, compound interest)
- Engineering calculations (area, volume, conversions)
- Statistical analysis and data processing
- Custom calculator generation for specific domains
